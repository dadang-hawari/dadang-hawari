# Hello!

My name is **Muh. Dadang Hawari** and I am a student majoring in Computer Engineering at the State University of Makassar.

I have a passion for web development and also enjoy working on Android development. I have worked on several projects, including an academic information system for web development and a project called “Love for UMKM.” I am currently participating in the Dicoding challenge and plan to share the “Love for UMKM” website once the challenge is finished.

If you’re interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out to me!
